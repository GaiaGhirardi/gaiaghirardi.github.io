# <span style="color:#a67b40"> PhD dissertation </span>

My PhD thesis explores how family socioeconomic conditions interact with children’s genotypes in shaping social inequalities in education and health. I find that the family's socioeconomic background can compensate, boost, or trigger genetic associations by contributing to the intergenerational reproduction of social inequality. My thesis can be found [here](https://cadmus.eui.eu/entities/publication/3c4e3998-e51f-40f0-a0e3-24ed7850dd8d).


<p>The illustrations below, drawn by my dearest friend and great artist, visualize the key findings and mechanisms found in the thesis.</p>
