**Ghirardi, G.**, & Gioachin, F. Center-based ECEC Closes Gaps, Others May Widen Them: A
Decomposition of How Different Childcare Arrangements Shape Early Educational Inequality.  [Here the pre-print](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9q6fk) (R&R)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
This research note investigates how childcare arrangements under age three affect early social inequalities in children’s competencies, relying on a novel decomposition approach (Yu and Elwert 2023). This approach allows us to provide a comprehensive evaluation of different childcare arrangements within a potential outcome framework, revealing not only the overall relevance of each childcare arrangement but also the importance of specific channels impacting social disparities such as prevalence (unequal exposure), effect (heterogeneous effect), and selection (within-group propensity to treatment). Using the newborn cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS - SC1), we assess the impact of early childhood education and care (ECEC), family day-care, grandparental care, and exclusive parental care on children’s competencies in mathematics and vocabulary at ages 4 and 5. Findings highlight ECEC as the most effective approach in reducing social disparities, positively influencing children from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Conversely, exclusive parental care and family day-care increase social disparities, benefiting children from higher socio-economic backgrounds while negatively affecting those from lower backgrounds. This comprehensive evaluation identifies channels impacting social inequalities, contributing to understanding the nuanced role of childcare arrangements in shaping early social inequalities in children’s competencies.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
A growing body of research investigates whether genetic influences on educational outcomes can be suppressed or boosted by the environment in which an individual lives. Indeed, several studies have examined the interaction between the genetic propensity for education and the socioeconomic status (SES) of the family of origin, the neighborhood, or school - so-called GxSES studies. However, results are mixed. Some studies find stronger associations between genetic propensities and educational outcomes in high-SES environments, while other studies find stronger associations in low-SES environments. In this work, we conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that investigated the interaction between genetic propensity for education and SES on measures of educational attainment and achievement. We focus on studies relying on molecular genetic information in the form of polygenic indices (PGI). This study aims to answer the following questions: (1) Does the genetic propensity for education matter more for educational outcomes in high or low-SES environments? (2) Which factors may explain the inconsistent findings of the previous literature? To address these questions, we collect results from both published and working papers investigating the interaction of interest and using molecular data.

Bernardi, F., Ferrara, A.  & **Ghirardi G.** Unequal Chance: Modeling Luck in Educational Inequality. 
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Sociology has paid limited attention to the role of luck in shaping individual
socioeconomic outcomes. This study examines how luck contributes to educational
disparities by family socioeconomic status (SES). We define luck as chance events that
provide or deplete resources for educational attainment and propose that unexplained
variance in regression models partly captures their influence. Building on the Breen and
Goldthorpe model of educational inequality, we introduce a stochastic component and
derive a novel hypothesis: luck has a greater impact when structural resources and
individual propensity for education are misaligned, specifically for low-SES students with
high educational propensity, and high-SES students with low propensity. We test this
hypothesis using variance function regression and replicate the analyses on two U.S.
datasets, using sibling fixed-effects models. We find support for our hypothesis and
conclude by reflecting on the implications for the emerging sociology of luck and broader
research on social stratification.
