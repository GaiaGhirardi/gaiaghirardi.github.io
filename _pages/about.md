I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center and the Einstein Center Population Diversity (ECPD). Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bologna, as part of the GENPOP project. I obtained my PhD (2025) in sociology at the Department of Political and Social Science at the [European University Institute (EUI)](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence.

My research aims to understand the intergenerational transmission of education and health outcomes from parents to children, also using molecular genetic data. My works have been published in _Demography_, _Social Science & Medicine_, _European Sociological Review_, _Social Science Research_, _Research in Social Stratification and Mobility_, and _Acta Sociologica_.
