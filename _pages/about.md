I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center and the [Einstein Center Population Diversity (ECPD)](https://einstein-diversity.com/team-member/gaia-ghirardi/). Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bologna, as part of the GENPOP project (2024-2026). I obtained my PhD in sociology at the Department of Political and Social Science at the European University Institute (EUI) (2025) in Florence.

My research aims to understand the intergenerational transmission of education and health outcomes from parents to children, also using molecular genetic data. My works have been published in _Demography_, _Social Science & Medicine_, _European Sociological Review_, _Social Science Research_, _Research in Social Stratification and Mobility_, and _Acta Sociologica_.
