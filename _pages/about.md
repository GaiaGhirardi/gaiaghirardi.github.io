I'm a [sociology PhD student](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=gaia-ghirardi) at the Department of Political and Social Science at the [European University Institute (EUI)](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence. I'm also a [research fellow at the University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/gaia.ghirardi) working on the [GENPOP](http://genpop.org) project. 


My research aims to understand the *intergenerational transmission* of social inequalities in educational and health outcomes using also molecular genetics data. In my PhD project, I focused on gene-environment interaction (GxE) to understand how genetic and environmental factors interact in shaping social inequality in education and health. 

My works have been published in _Social Science Research_, _European Sociological Review_, and _Research in Social Stratification and Mobility_.
