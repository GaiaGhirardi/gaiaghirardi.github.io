I'm a [research fellow at the University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/gaia.ghirardi) working at the [GENPOP](http://genpop.org) project. I obtained my PhD in sociology at the Department of Political and Social Science at the [European University Institute (EUI)](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence.

My research aims to understand the intergenerational transmission of education and health outcomes from parents to children. In my [PhD dissertation](https://cadmus.eui.eu/entities/publication/3c4e3998-e51f-40f0-a0e3-24ed7850dd8d), I focused on gene-environment interaction (GxE) to understand how genetic and environmental factors interact in shaping social inequality in education and health. 

My works have been published in _Social Science Research_, _European Sociological Review_, and _Research in Social Stratification and Mobility_.
