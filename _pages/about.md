I'm a [postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/gaia.ghirardi) working at the [GENPOP](http://genpop.org) project. I obtained my PhD in sociology at the Department of Political and Social Science at the [European University Institute (EUI)](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence.

My research aims to understand the intergenerational transmission of education and health outcomes from parents to children, also using molecular genetic data. My works have been published in _Demography_, _Social Science & Medicine_, _European Sociological Review_, _Social Science Research_, and _Research in Social Stratification and Mobility_.
